#' Matrix Profile for R
#'
#' This package is derived from the former package `tsmp`. It is intended to make a clear separation of what is the
#' Matrix Profile computation and what are the data mining process we can do using Matrix Profile.
#'
#' @details
#' The Matrix Profile, has the potential to revolutionize time series data mining because of its generality,
#' versatility, simplicity and scalability. In particular it has implications for time series motif discovery, time
#' series joins, shapelet discovery (classification), density estimation, semantic segmentation, visualization, rule
#' discovery, clustering etc.
