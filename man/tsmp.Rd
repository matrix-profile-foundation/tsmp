\value{
Returns the matrix profile \code{mp} and profile index \code{pi}. It also returns the left and
right matrix profile \code{lmp}, \code{rmp} and profile index \code{lpi}, \code{rpi} that may be used to detect
Time Series Chains. \code{\link[=mstomp]{mstomp()}} returns a multidimensional Matrix Profile.

\description{
This is a wrap function that makes easy to use all available algorithms to compute the Matrix
Profile and Profile Index for multiple purposes.

\details{
The Matrix Profile, has the potential to revolutionize time series data mining because
of its generality, versatility, simplicity and scalability. In particular it has implications
for time series motif discovery, time series joins, shapelet discovery (classification),
density estimation, semantic segmentation, visualization, rule discovery, clustering etc.

The first algorithm invented was the \code{\link[=stamp]{stamp()}} that using \code{\link[=mass]{mass()}} as an ultra-fast Algorithm
for Similarity Search allowed to compute the Matrix Profile in reasonable time. One of its main
feature was its Anytime property which using a randomized approach could return a "best-so-far"
matrix that could give us the correct answer (using for example 1/10 of all iterations) almost
every time.

The next algorithm was \code{\link[=stomp]{stomp()}} that currently is the most used. Researchers noticed that the
dot products do not need to be recalculated from scratch for each subsequence. Instead, we can
reuse the values calculated for the first subsequence to make a faster calculation in the next
iterations. The idea is to make use of the intersections between the required products in
consecutive iterations. This approach reduced the time to compute the Matrix Profile to about
3\% compared to \code{\link[=stamp]{stamp()}}, but on the other hand, we lost the Anytime property.

Currently there is a new algorithm that I'll not explain further here. It is called \code{\link[=scrimp]{scrimp()}},
and is as fast as \code{\link[=stomp]{stomp()}}, and have the Anytime property. This algorithm is implemented in
this package, but still waiting for an article publication.

Further, there is the \code{\link[=mstomp]{mstomp()}} that computes a multidimensional Matrix Profile that allows to
meaningful MOTIF discovery in Multivariate Time Series. And \code{\link[=simple_fast]{simple_fast()}} that also handles
Multivariate Time Series, but focused in Music Analysis and Exploration.

The \code{\link[=valmod]{valmod()}} uses a new pruning algorithm allowing a similarity search with a range of sliding
window sizes.

The \code{\link[=pmp]{pmp()}} is a new concept that creates several profiles from a range of windows.

Some parameters are global across the algorithms:
\describe{
\item{...}{One or two time series (except for \code{\link[=mstomp]{mstomp()}}). The second time series can be smaller than the first.}
\item{window_size}{The sliding window.}
\item{exclusion_zone}{Is used to avoid trivial matches; if a query data is provided
(join similarity), this parameter is ignored.}
\item{verbose}{Changes how much information is printed by this function; \code{0} means nothing,
\code{1} means text, \code{2} adds the progress bar, \code{3} adds the finish sound.}
\item{n_workers}{number of threads for parallel computing (except \code{simple_fast}, \code{scrimp} and \code{valmod}).
If the value is 2 or more, the '_par' version of the algorithm will be used.}
}

\code{s_size} is used only in Anytime algorithms: \code{\link[=stamp]{stamp()}} and \code{\link[=scrimp]{scrimp()}}.
\code{must_dim} and \code{exc_dim} are used only in \code{\link[=mstomp]{mstomp()}}.
\code{heap_size} is used only for \code{\link[=valmod]{valmod()}}
\code{mode} can be any of the following: \code{stomp}, \code{stamp}, \code{simple}, \code{mstomp}, \code{scrimp}, \code{valmod}, \code{pmp}.

# Anytime STAMP

# [mstomp()]
mp <- tsmp(mp_toy_data$data[1:200, ], window_size = 30, mode = "mstomp", verbose = 0)

# [simple_fast()]
mp <- tsmp(mp_toy_data$data[1:200, ], window_size = 30, mode = "simple", verbose = 0)
\donttest{
